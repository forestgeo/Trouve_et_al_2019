The Trouve_al_2019_JoE_tree_mortality.csv file contains the third and fourth census (presence of the 2005 fire) data necessary to fit the species and size-dependent background and fire-related mortality model. The file provides information on individual tree location within the 50 ha plot (quadrat_number_50m, quadrat_x_coord, quadrat_y_coord), tree species (sp), the measurement census number (census_id), the measurement date of the census (date_meas_census3), the dbh of the tree in the third census (dbh_cm_census3), and the mortality status of the tree in the third and fourth census (tree_status_census3, tree_status_census4). Variable tree_status_census4 is used as a binary response variable (alive = 0 , dead = 1) in the mortality model.
The Trouve_al_2019_JoE_tree_growth.csv file contains the data necessary to estimate median and 95% percentile growth per species in between the second and third census (absence of a fire). The file contains individual tree location within the 50 ha plot (quadrat_number_50m, quadrat_x_coord, quadrat_y_coord), tree species (sp), the measurement census number (census_id), the measurement date of the second census (date_meas_census2), the dbh of the tree in the second census (dbh_cm_census2), and tree dbh increment in between the second and third census (dbh_increment_cm_per_year_census_2_to_3).
The Trouve_al_2019_JoE_canopy_status_and_forest_type_per_species.csv file contains the canopy status and forest type group for each species used in the paper.
